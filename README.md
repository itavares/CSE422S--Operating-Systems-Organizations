# CSE422S--Operating-Systems-Organizations
This course intends to give hands-on experience working with the Linux operating system kernel, and covering a breadth of basic operating systems issues. The course will emphasize the developing and applying skills and techniques for profiling, quantifying, and evaluating operating system behaviors based on an understanding of the policies and mechanisms that govern those behaviors. The objectives of this course are for each student to:  develop a strong intuition about the operation of the Linux kernel; use tools to monitor and examine what kernel mechanisms are actually doing; and gain hands-on experience using and evaluating kernel mechanisms.
